# Crypto Arbitrage Analysis in 2018
The purpose of this program is to perform a quantitative analysis of arbitrage profits made by crypto traders in early 2018. It is written to teach the user how to use Python and JupyterLab to solve for arbitrage profits and visualize the data.

## Technologies

**A Python 3 (ipykernal) in JupyterLab** was used to write this application. 
Additional Python libraries are imported into the start of the app: ***pandas, Path from pathlib, matplotlib inline, and warnings*

## Installation Guide

To use the app, download the crypto_arbitrage.ipynb Jupyter file and the Resources Folder. Use either Terminal or Git Bash to run the app in a conda dev environment. 
To enter a conda dev environment, type
'conda activate dev'

To run the app, navigate to the directory containing the crypto_arbitrage.inpyb file and then type
'jupyter lab'

## Usage

As you run through the calculations in the kernal, observe how crypto arbitrage profits changed from January to March in 2020. By the end of the program you should understand that crypto traders in Jan 2018 were making high arbitrage profits between bitstamp and coinbase, and by March 2018, their Arbitrage profits were dried up.
